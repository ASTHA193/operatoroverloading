# operatoroverloading
Operator overloading is a type of polymorphism in which a single operator is overloaded to give user defined meaning to it. Operator overloading provides a flexibility option for creating new definitions of C++ operators. 
By overloading standard operators on a class , you can exploit the intuition of the users of that class. This lets users program in the language of the problem domain rather than in the language of the machine.
The ultimate goal is to reduce both the learning curve and the defect rate.<br/>

Operator overloading is an important concept in C++. It is a type of polymorphism in which an operator is overloaded to give user defined meaning to it. Overloaded operator is used to perform operation on user-defined data type. For example '+' operator can be overloaded to perform addition on various data types, like for Integer, String(concatenation) etc.
